First project made in a starter online bootcamp organized by Rocketseat.

I used HTML5, CSS3 and JavaScript to create a onepage website for a made up Beauty Salon.
the images were imported from unsplash.com and the icons from icomoon.com.

I used the API from Whatsapp for the contact buttons.

This is a study project and is not meant to be sold. The project was made to learn the basics of HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
